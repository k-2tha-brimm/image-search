Built using Create React App. This simple app allows the user to search for an image using the Pixabay API.

## Running Locally

To run the app locally, clone the repository and perform an `npm install`.

Before launching the app, be sure to add the `REACT_APP_PIXABAY_KEY` variable to the `package.json`, prepending either your `start` or `build` command (`"start": "REACT_APP_PIXABAY_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE> react-scripts start"`, for example). Then navigate to your `localhost` to test it out. Happy searching!
